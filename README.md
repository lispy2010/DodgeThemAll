# Dodge them all
Dodge them all is a video game where you dodge colorful squares. This game is mostly made using
Electron and TypeScript.

## Dependencies
This game only depends on Electron and Electron Packager (for packaging). To install, run
`intsall-deps.bat`

## Colorful squares
This game has got a lot of colors and **flashing images**, so be careful with that.
And about the colorful squares, which are actually enemies, here is a list of them:
* The red guy. He just bounces off the walls.
* The cyan guy. He is pretty much the exact same as the red guy, but with a different moving pattern.
* The rainbow guy. He bounces like a ball, but he is a square.
* The smart guy. Because he is smart, he can calculate where exctly to go to get the player. His movement may vary.
* The brown guy. He is slow... and has the same moving pattern as the red guy.
* Walking guy. He does not care about what the player is doing, he just moves wherever he wants.
* And finally, the boss. He is very big and shoots orange bullets. He spawns every sixth level.

## How to play
To move the player, you can use WASD or the arrow keys. To pause the game, use Escape. To go to the shop, use Enter.

## Sandbox mode (**Unfinished!**)
In sandbox mode, you can create an enemy and change its properties like speed, color, size, etc. And by pressing Space, you can summon an AI player.
